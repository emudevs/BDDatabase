# (Black Desert Online) BD Database

Community Sup,

I created a tool based on the database API
It is very simple. You can enter the element identifier or name to find the identifier / name of this element.
You can also use bdocodex or bddatabase, but I thought that having a program that shows everything I need quickly and easily would be nice.
Nothing fundamental, but it helped me when working with the database, so why not release it.

# UPD
- New database with many items
- Multi-language (EN, DE, FR, RU, ES, SP, PT, JP, KR, CN, TW, TH, TR, ID)
